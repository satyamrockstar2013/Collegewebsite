        About Department
      </h2>
      <div>
       <p>The Department of Aeronautical Engineering at Prasad V. Potluri Siddhartha Institute of Technology was established in the year 2009. The department has started B.Tech program with an initial intake of 30 in the year 2009. Aeronautical Engineering is a pioneering and well emerging core branch of engineering which deals with Design, Development and Production of Aircrafts, Missiles and Launch Vehicles. In our college, the facilities are available to make the students to learn this course in a very sophisticated way. The department has a team of highly qualified, dedicated and motivated faculty and well equipped laboratories. There is a great future of Aeronautical Engineering. After open market system, airplane companies are coming to India and as result there is increase in number of airplanes. Thus demand of Aeronautical Engineers will increase further. Aeronautical Engineering has a very bright future.</p>

       <p>There is huge number of possibilities and jobs available in the aerospace industry and aviation industry for aeronautical engineers and great room for personal growth and development and the demand for aerospace engineers is likely to remain so as there is a boom in world travel, aviation and aircraft industries. Many government, defense and space agencies are also on the lookout for aeronautical engineers to develop the future of flying vehicles and systems.</p>

       <p>We are proud to say that our Aeronautical Engineering Department has started PVP Siddhartha Aero Club to develop interest in Aircraft modeling. The department prepares the graduates to undertake design, research and maintenance activities to choose their careers in aeronautical engineering.</p>
