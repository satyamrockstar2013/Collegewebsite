Our vision is to be recognized as innovative and leading Information Technology Department. Our goal is to provide students with a balance of intellectual and practical experiences that enable them to serve a variety of societal needs. In our department students are nurtured to become best software professionals as Project Managers, System Analysts or Team leaders in Industry or become Entrepreneurs in their own innovative way.</p>

        <p>I am sure in times to come; many students from our department will make indelible mark nationally and internationally in the field of Information Technology and make us proud. We are having young and dynamic faculty who are intellectually vibrant and whose expertise spans the range of disciplines in computer science stream, a very healthy work-culture and hard-working students, which are the basic elements that comprises the Department of Information Technology and the hub of the institute's academia.</p>

         <p>We hold firm belief in our ability towards success, and we nurture an attitude of self-reliance, confidence, commitment and responsibility to the motherland that we are to serve. Such is the psychology behind the young and dynamic IT department in effect. The Department of IT believes in career building, enriching minds and provides an incredible experience that lasts for a life time. I am confident that the students of the department will justify the credibility of the department by showing a high level professional competence in their respective domains.
