    About Department

  <div>
    <p>Mechanical Engineering has been evergreen course from centuries. Opting mechanical engineering flourishes the students with diversified knowledge in design, thermal, industrial and production streams. This batch (2011-15) of students has acquired communicative competence along with technical skills. In addition, with their sincere efforts these students can prove their mettle and soar great heights in their life. They in turn will be a great inspiration to juniors. Furthermore their innovative outlook, exemplary nature and above all; their self confidence would surely enable them to turn their dreams into reality. With innovative project works they have fine tuned themselves to meet the changing demands and are ready to face the challenges of the modern world. Wherever they are, they would prove themselves to be an asset not only to the organization which they serve but to the entire nation as well. I wish them success and everlasting joy all through their lives. May each one them turn out to be an alumnus of vast repute! </p>
